Lessons for introducing coding skills using the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft

#Introduction
This sequence of lessons will introduce students to variables, Boolean logic, conditionals, and loops using the various computer themed blocks in ComputerCraft, a mod created for Minecraft that adds computers, monitors, modems, turtles, and more! ComputerCraft’s computers and turtles are programmed with the easy-to-learn Lua programming language.

There is a ComputerCraft Map ready made with terminals set up and challenges ready for when you reach lesson 7, it is not necessary to use it, however if you would like a copy you can download it [here](https://github.com/AllenHeard/ComputerCraft/blob/master/ComputerCraft%20World/ComputerCraft.zip).

ComputerCraft items are placed in the word in the same was as normal blocks. Monitor blocks can be built up to make large multi-block monitors.

Modems can be added to computers to allow communication.

Programs can be saved on disks placed in disk drives and removed for future use.

There are a variety of turtles, we will be using a mining turtle.

You can have basic monitors or colour monitors as well as handheld computers.

##Computing Programme of Study Met 
**KS2**
 - Use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables 
 - Use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and to detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs
 - Use technology safely, respectfully and responsibly; recognise acceptable/unacceptable behaviour.

##Resources
For this series of lessons you will need Minecraft/MinecraftEDU installed along with the forge mod loader and the ComputerCraft mod for version 1.7.10
